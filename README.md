# StableMarriageProgram

This project was put together as part of completing my MSc Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. To read fully about what the project was about and all the algorithms implemented see the <b>Dissertation D2.pdf</b> file.

In short the code here implements several variations of algorithms used to solve the Stable Marriage Problem, a well known matching problem in the field of combinatorics. Each algorithm produces an optimal stable marriage based on different definitions of what 'optimal' is. The program will generate a population with random preference lists, calculate the optimal stable marriage of each algorithm, and  output metrics about each of these optimal stable marriages that can be used for comparison as well as some graphs pertaining to the 'Rotations'(see <b>Dissertation D2.pdf</b>) found in the population set. The Rotations produced by the program can be used to get every single stable marriage in the population set. 

To run the code execute the below:<br>
```java StableMarriageProgram```
